### `Initial Release`

# **Version 1.1 - Windows**

Back in 2016, a windows software with very basic functions has been released. It only had Urdu support, and a simple interface asking for `rhyme-end` and `number of characters` in the output.

You can have a look at the windows version [here.](https://www.shakeeb.in/2017/01/qaafiyah-expert-by-shakeeb-ahmad.html) A detailed history with discussions has been stored on Urdu Mehfil forum [here.](https://www.urduweb.org/mehfil/threads/%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C%DB%81-%D8%A7%DB%8C%DA%A9%D8%B3%D9%BE%D8%B1%D9%B9-%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%DA%A9%DB%92-%D9%84%DB%8C%DB%92-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%81%DB%81.88892/)

I was a college student back then. This version didn't get any updates.
